Introduction:  
Many people struggle to decide what to cook, especially when they have dietary restrictions, limited ingredients available, or want a specific type of meal. Traditional recipe websites often overwhelm users with choices that are not tailored to their specific needs. This project addresses that challenge by providing a recommendation system that helps users effectively find recipes that suit their requirements and needs.  
  
Objectives:  
- Design a recipe recommendation system that personalizes suggestions based on user
preferences and available ingredients.  
- Implement basic filters such as ingredient and equipment availability, dietary restrictions,
and cuisine type.  
- Provide an intuitive interface that makes browsing and selecting recipes straightforward
and easy.  
  
Scope:  
This project will focus on implementing core features of a recipe recommendation system. Users of this will be able to create accounts with login and authentication, create their own recipes, and search through existing recipes using filters such as available ingredients and equipment, dietary restrictions, and cuisine type. This project will also provide recipe recommendations based on user preferences. Features such as nutrition tracking, grocery shopping/planning integration, and long term meal planning will not be within the scope of this project.  
  
Proposed solution:  
We will create a software application recipe recommender that personalizes the user's diet / pantry based on their personal interests. The users will create a profile and choose ingredients they currently have, then run those ingredients through a recommendation algorithm, then rank recipes based on the users preferences. The target users are individuals who enjoy cooking at home, don't have the time to sift through irrelevant recipes, those who want specific recipes based on their dietary restrictions, and those wanting to use specific ingredients/equipment.
  
Technology stack:  
Frontend: react.js  
Backend: python  
Database: postgreSQL  
  
Expected outcomes:  
The final delivered product will be a working prototype that:  
- Has user login and authentication  
- Can create recipes tied to the user that creates them  
- Can search through all users’ recipes based on ingredients/equipment, dietary restrictions and cuisine type
